# Capstone-Project
In the MGTC28 Capstone Project, students will work on real datasets to get an experience of what data scientists go through in real life. The group assignment's objectives are to define a business problem, look for data on the web, and use Foursquare location data to compare different neighbourhoods in Toronto to figure out which neighbourhood is suitable for starting a new local business. The UTSC Venture Capital Fund is investing up to $1 million CAD in your group to launch a new local business, anywhere within the city.  Your group is open to pitch any business ideas that is profitable in the next couple of years.
